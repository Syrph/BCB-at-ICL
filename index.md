### Introduction

On this site you can find the practical resources for the Biodiversity and Conservation Biology undergraduate course, at Imperial College London. These practicals are designed to introduce the basic concepts of phylogenetic methods in R, which are commonly used in ecology and evolutionary biology. You will also be introduced to basic GIS in R, another valuable skill in research and conversation. All the data required for each practical are available on Blackboard.
